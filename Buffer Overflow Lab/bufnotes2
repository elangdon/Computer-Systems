EAX : accumulator : used for performing calculations, and used to store return values from function calls. Basic operations such as add, subtract, compare use this general-purpose register
EBX : base (does not have anything to do with base pointer). It has no general purpose and can be used to store data.
ECX : counter : used for iterations. ECX counts downward.
EDX : data : this is an extension of the EAX register. It allows for more complex calculations (multiply, divide) by allowing extra data to be stored to facilitate those calculations.
ESP : stack pointer
EBP : base pointer
ESI : source index : holds location of input data
EDI : destination index  : points to location of where result of data operation is stored
EIP : instruction pointer
